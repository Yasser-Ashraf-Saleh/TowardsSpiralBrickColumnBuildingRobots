# TowardsSpiralBrickColumnBuildingRobots
In this project, we proposed a task-level approach for assembly of spiral brick columns. Our extensive computational simulations using the generalized models of spiral brick columns show the feasibility, the effectiveness and efÔ¨Åciency of our proposed approach.
# Overview 
# Problem Statment:
The construction industry, a cornerstone of the global market, faces inherent challenges in labour productivity compared to other technology-intensive sectors. Automation in construction, particularly in the assembly of complex structures like spiral brick columns, holds the potential to enhance efficiency and productivity. The existing literature discusses the integration of robotics and additive manufacturing in construction, but there is a need to address specific challenges related to the assembly of spiral brick columns.

# Objective:
The objective of this project is to propose a task-level approach for the autonomous assembly of spiral brick columns. The focus is on leveraging computational simulations and generalized models to demonstrate the proposed approach's feasibility, effectiveness, and efficiency. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the advancement of automated construction methods, specifically targeting the assembly of aesthetically pleasing spiral brick columns.

# Motivation:
The motivation behind this project stems from the growing importance of automation in construction to overcome labour-intensive limitations and increase productivity. As the construction industry is poised to surpass $10 trillion by 2021, addressing the challenges through innovative and automated approaches becomes crucial. The project aims to fill a gap in the existing research by focusing on task-level planning for the assembly of spiral brick columns, a relatively unexplored area.
