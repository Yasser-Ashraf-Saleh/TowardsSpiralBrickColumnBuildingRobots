# TowardsSpiralBrickColumnBuildingRobots
In this project we propose a task-level approach for assembly of spiral brick columns. Our extensive computational simulations using the generalized models of spiral brick columns show the feasibility, the effectiveness and efÔ¨Åciency of our proposed approach.
